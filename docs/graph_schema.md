# Graph Schema & Provenance Model (MVP)

## Goals
- Every node and edge carries **provenance** so downstream agents and humans can trust or discount facts.
- Distinguish hard deterministic facts (from tree-sitter + clang / ast / cargo metadata) from LLM-inferred ones.
- The primary interchange format for GraphRAG is the **BYOG parquets** (`entities.parquet`, `relationships.parquet`, optional `text_units.parquet`).

## Core Tables (BYOG contract)
See official GraphRAG output schema + BYOG page for base columns.

We extend with code-specific columns (present on both entities and relationships where applicable):

- `source_file`: relative path in the original repo
- `span`: either "line:col-line:col", "def foo", or byte range
- `extractor`: "tree-sitter-python", "clang-ast", "manual", "llm-entity-v1", etc.
- `confidence`: float [0,1] — 1.0 for deterministic parser facts
- `is_deterministic`: bool — true when the fact can be re-derived from source without LLM

## Entity Types (code domain, start with these)
- file
- module / package
- function / method
- class / struct / enum / trait
- type_alias
- constant / variable (top level)
- test (special for golden traces)

### C module keys (conditional, collision-safe)

C file and symbol titles use a **module key** prefix shared by `scripts/extract_c.py`
and `scripts/c_compiler_facts.py` (`scripts/c_identities.py`):

1. Index every package `.c` / `.h` file.
2. If `path.stem` appears under only one parent directory, the module key is that
   stem (legacy-compatible: `cJSON.c` + `cJSON.h` → `cJSON`).
3. If the same stem appears under multiple parents, each parent group uses the
   package-relative POSIX path of `parent/stem` (no suffix), e.g.
   `src/left/util.c` → `src/left/util`, `src/right/util.c` → `src/right/util`.

Titles remain `{module_key}:{filename_or_symbol}`. Entity IDs embed the full
title (not a lossy slug alone). Packages without stem collisions keep the same
graph identities as before. Indexed paths that resolve outside the package, or
multiple package paths that resolve to the same file, fail explicitly rather
than receiving a guessed identity.

## Relationship Types (or rich description + type column)
- contains (file→function, module→symbol)
- calls / is_called_by
- imports / depends_on
- implements / inherits
- uses_type
- defines
- tests (test entity → symbol under test)

### Optional C compiler TU dependency overlay (`depends_on`)

When `scripts/index_c.py --compiler-dependencies` is enabled (default **off**),
the tree-sitter-c graph gains flattened file→file `depends_on` edges from each
`compile_commands.json` translation unit to package-local `.c`/`.h` paths the
configured compiler reports under dependency-generation mode (`-M`, followed
by strict package-path filtering so package-local `-isystem` headers remain
visible while system/outside-package paths do not).

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | `depends_on` (never `includes`) |
| `source` / `target` | Existing file-entity titles from `extract_c` (`{module_key}:{filename}`, see C module keys above) |
| `fact_kind` | `translation_unit_dependency` |
| `extractor` | `c-compiler-deps` |
| `confidence` / `is_deterministic` | `1.0` / `true` **only** relative to the recorded toolchain + `compile_commands.json` (not pure syntax, not a direct `#include` claim) |
| Provenance | `compiler_path`, `compiler_id`, `compile_commands_digest` |
| Description | States that the edge is compiler/configuration-derived and may be transitive |

**Out of scope for this overlay:** clang AST type resolution, direct-include
provenance, multi-config coverage, system/outside-package headers, and
production C/C++ completeness. Default indexing leaves published graph counts
unchanged (overlay off). Snapshot manifests record a `compiler_dependencies`
block (`mode`, compiler identity, configuration digest, fact count, TU count).
The adapter currently supports GNU/Clang dependency flags on `clang`, `cc`, or
`gcc` entries; compiler wrappers, response-file expansion, and MSVC are outside
this increment and fail rather than silently selecting another toolchain.

## Example Row (entities)
```json
{
  "id": "ent:fn:physics.update_player",
  "title": "update_player",
  "type": "function",
  "description": "Advances one physics tick. Applies jump/gravity/horizontal and checks collisions.",
  "text_unit_ids": ["tu:sim:42-67"],
  "source_file": "examples/mini_game/physics.py",
  "span": "18:0-35:10",
  "extractor": "tree-sitter-python",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "is_deterministic": true
}
```

## Usage in Phase 0+
1. Parser (tree-sitter + semantic) → normalized in-memory graph or intermediate records.
2. Serializer → exactly the three BYOG parquets (with our extra columns).
3. `graphrag index --root <proj>` with `workflows: [create_communities, create_community_reports, ...]`
4. Query layer consumes the resulting communities + reports + original parquets.

## Early Decisions (2026-06-15)
- Weight on relationships is mandatory for Leiden (per GraphRAG docs).
- Keep a parallel normalized NetworkX / DuckDB view for fast custom traversals ("callers of X", impact analysis) while the parquet files remain the source of truth for GraphRAG.
- All uncertain dynamic calls / macros / templates must be emitted with confidence < 1.0 and `is_deterministic=false`.

Update this doc as the parser and context-pack requirements evolve.
